SnakeGame as the name suggests, is the classic Snake Game I decided to take up as a project from a friend's suggestion on the 22/03.
I decided that as a student, it should be a fun project with new learning experience.

You don't need any external dependencies to run the project - it is all based on the standard library.
The game itself is very simple. You move around with awsd and if you hit the wall or eat yourself, you die and reset back to the beginning.
